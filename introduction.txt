JAsm (Java Assembly) is a Java-interpreted assembly-like code. It is designed to be a simple, easy to use, and easy to learn language.
JAsmVM (Java Assembly Virtual Machine) is a Java-based virtual machine for JAsm. It is designed to provide a small and easy to use
virtual environment for writing and running JAsm, it is also useful because it displays every modification occurred to memory and registers.
JAsm memory structure is based on 3 main components:
    - Registers (4 registers, each one separated into 5 parts of 8 bits each (e.g. X0, X1, ..., X9)), mainly used for storing
        temporary values and for arithmetic operations.
    - Memory (256 bytes of memory), used to store data from variables declared in the code.
    - Variables Name Table[VNT] (256 bytes of memory), used to store the names of the variables declared in the code and their
        addresses in memory so that the program could retrieve the value of a variable by doing a cross-reference through
        the memory and the VNT.
While in the memory it will be possible to store any kind of data (numbers, characters, strings), in the registers only numbers will be stored.
